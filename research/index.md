# Research

My research focuses on the **formation and evolution of galaxies**, primarily from an **observational perspective**.  I am interested in how galaxies interact, evolve, and regulate their star formation and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. My work spans three interconnected directions:

### Galaxy Interactions and Mergers
I study the observational signatures of galaxies at different stages of interaction and merging, aiming to uncover the physical mechanisms that drive morphological transformation, gas inflow, and star formation enhancement or suppression during these dynamical processes.

### Gas Kinematics in Galaxies
I investigate the velocity fields of ionized gas to understand how gas accretion, dynamical perturbations, and feedback processes shape the internal kinematic structure of galaxies. These studies help reveal how gaseous motions trace the evolutionary state of galaxies and their surrounding environments.

### Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS)
I employ integral field spectroscopic observations to explore the spatially resolved properties of galaxies, such as star formation, metallicity, and kinematics. In parallel, I develop numerical tools and simulation packages to interpret and reproduce IFS datacubes from large surveys and future missions, including the **Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS)**.


## Research Highlight

###  Galaxy Interaction
- Search the isolated compact galaxy systems, such as galaxy pairs ([Shen et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RAA....16...43S/abstract),[Feng et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880..114F/abstract)), galaxy triplets ([Feng et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RAA....16...72F/abstract)), and galaxy groups ([Zheng et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..119Z/abstract)), based on [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/) Main Galaxy Sample. Through supplementing a large number of spectral redshifts from other surveys (e.g. [LAMOST](https://www.lamost.org/public/?locale=en), [GAMA](http://www.gama-survey.org/)), the completeness significantly increases. 
- Calculate the bivariate luminosity function of galaxy pairs, which provides the complete description of the luminosity of galaxy pairs in the low-z universe and statistical constraints for the merging timescale and starburst timescale ([Feng et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880..114F/abstract)).

### Kinematics of Ionized Gas
- Detect the correlation between star formation enhancement and disturbed velocity maps of ionized gas in galaxy pairs ([Feng et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..20F/abstract)), indicating that the kinematic asymmetry (the asymmetric degree of velocity map morphology) is a good indicator of galaxy merging phase ([Yu et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..114Y/abstract)).
- Make a census on the kinematic asymmetry of ionized gas in the local universe based on the data of [SDSS-IV MaNGA](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/manga/) survey, and unveil that the regular galaxies dominate the population with high kinematic asymmetry([Feng et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220706050F/abstract)).

### Simulation of IFS Datacube
- Develop [gehong](https://csst-ifs-gehong.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to simulate the datacube observed by the integral field spectrometer on board the Chinese Space Station telescope (CSST-IFS).
